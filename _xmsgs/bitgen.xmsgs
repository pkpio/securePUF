<msg type="info" file="Bitgen" num="40" delta="old" >Replacing &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Auto</arg>&quot; with &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">2</arg>&quot; for option &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">Match_cycle</arg>&quot;.  Most commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the generic command-line value of &quot;Auto&quot;.  Alternately, this message appears if the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this case, the option listed last will be used.
